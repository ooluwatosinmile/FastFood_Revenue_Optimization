# 📈 SQL EDA: Driving High Margin Revenue in Multi-National Sales

## 🎯 Executive Summary

This project conducts an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on fast-food sales data from five European cities using **SQL** for all aggregation and analysis.

The analysis identified key revenue opportunities and operational weaknesses:

* **High Margin Focus:** Burgers are the highest margin product (Avg Price: $12.99), but low sales volume prevents them from driving maximum profit.
* **Critical Weakness:** Sales volume drops by approximately **70% every Sunday**, representing the largest revenue recovery opportunity.
* **Actionable Strategy:** The final analysis isolated the top two high margin performers, **Joao Silva (Lisbon)** and **Tom Jackson (London)**, who represent successful models for **In-store** and **Online** high margin sales, respectively.

## 🛠️ Methodology and Project Files

The entire analysis was performed using **SQL** to aggregate and segment data, ensuring accuracy and efficiency across the large dataset. The final insights were derived by combining key results from multiple queries.

### Project Files:

* **`eda_queries.sql`**: Contains the full script of all 15+ SQL queries used for the analysis, including initial cleaning checks, univariate, and multivariate aggregations.
* **`README.md`**: The current document, presenting the final narrative and actionable strategy.
* **`sample_data.csv`**: A small sample of the dataset structure for context and replication.
