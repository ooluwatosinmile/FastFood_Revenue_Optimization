# 📈 SQL EDA: Driving High Margin Revenue in Multi-National Sales

## 🎯 Executive Summary

This project conducts an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on fast-food sales data from five European cities using **SQL** for all aggregation and analysis.

The analysis identified key revenue opportunities and operational weaknesses:

* **High Margin Focus:** Burgers are the highest margin product (Avg Price: $12.99), but low sales volume prevents them from driving maximum profit.
* **Critical Weakness:** Sales volume drops by approximately **70% every Sunday**, representing the largest revenue recovery opportunity.
* **Actionable Strategy:** The final analysis isolated the top two high margin performers, **Joao Silva (Lisbon)** and **Tom Jackson (London)**, who represent successful models for **In-store** and **Online** high margin sales, respectively.
